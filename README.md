# AHKscripts
The AutoHotKey scripts that we use for Premiere, Explorer, and more!

"I'm the person who actually made TCA Tech. I used to edit with Wondershare Filmora (not sponsored), and I wanted to edit faster, so I watched some tutorials, and coded some AutoHotKey scripts. Now that I use Premiere, I can now edit EVEN faster. Thanks, Premiere. :)" - @imTCA

"I'm one of the main video editors for TCA's YouTube Channels, alongside TCA. He gives me a lot of footage, so I had to learn how to work quickly, without sacrificing quality, and TCA just gave me these AutoHotKey scripts, and they helped me a lot in the editing process." - @Ye11owed
