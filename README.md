# AHKscripts
The AutoHotKey scripts that we use for Premiere, Explorer, and more!

> "I'm the person who actually made TCA Tech. I used to edit with Wondershare Filmora (not sponsored), and I wanted to edit faster, so I watched some tutorials, and coded some AutoHotKey scripts. Now that I use Premiere, I can now edit EVEN faster. Thanks, Premiere. :)" - [TCA](https://github.com/imTCA)

> "I'm one of the main video editors for TCA's YouTube Channels, alongside TCA. He gives me a lot of footage, so I had to learn how to work quickly, without sacrificing quality, and TCA just gave me these AutoHotKey scripts, and they helped me a lot in the editing process." - [Yellowed](https://github.com/Ye11owed)

### Our AHK scripts

IF YOU ARE NEW TO AUTOHOTKEY, start here: https://autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm

I know there's a lot of scripts in this repository. Look here to see what launches when me and Yellowed start our PCs: https://github.com/TCAandYellowed/AHKscripts/blob/main/INFO_and_PROFILES/Startup_Folder.png

Some of the scripts are #include-d in other scripts. The MAIN script from which most others are run, is this one - so, you can start here: https://github.com/TCAandYellowed/AHKscripts/blob/main/ALL_KEYBOARD_ASSIGNMENTS.ahk

Some scripts can stand entirely on their own, like this one: https://github.com/TCAandYellowed/AHKscripts/blob/main/Windows_Mods/Both_Accelerated_Scrolling_1.3_AND_Cursor_click_visualizer.ahk

All our custom Premiere, Photoshop, and After Effects keyboard shortcuts can be found here: https://github.com/TCAandYellowed/AHKscripts/tree/main/Settings_and_shortcuts

Please note, we're not real programmers (in this lifetime.) Our organization can be bad, and sometimes our code can be spaghetti-y. We have, however, done extensive commenting... so if you know how to code, it should be pretty easy to figure out what's going on.

Help with this repository is appreciated, but don't feel bad if we never officially merge your scripts. We can't trust anything that me and Yellowed haven't fully tested ourselves, or something with code that we don't recognise or understand. These are our real day-to-day working scripts, so we can't compromise them for anybody.

Sometimes Yellowed puts out tutorials/Behind The Scenes/Deleted Scenes on his personal channel: https://to.imTCA.tk/yellowed

If you want to contact us, you can check out a full list of options here: https://github.com/TCAandYellowed/HowToContactUs/blob/main/README.md

You're free to use any of these scripts for yourself. Take what you need, modify it to your heart's content, and upload it to Github or YouTube (with credit that leads back to this repo).

Currently our root directory is this:

**C:\AHK**

which is great, since you guys don't have to change all the scattered instances of "imTCA" or "Yellowed" to their own username. Now, a huge amount of the scripts are turn-key, as long as you don't move anything or change any file paths.

The only disadvantage is that these AHK scripts will be available to ALL users on a machine. If you share a computer, you may wish to move them under your user account after all.

Make sure to populate your startup folder with file shortcuts, to launch all the scripts you want as soon as the computer boots up. KEEP IN MIND that there are TWO startup folders - one for your user account, and one for ALL users. Here they are:

`*appdata*\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
(You can open up this by typing "shell:startup" in the explorer bar.) 

`C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp`
(You can open up this by typing "shell:Common Startup" in the explorer bar.)
