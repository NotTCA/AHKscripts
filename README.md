# AHKscripts
The AutoHotKey scripts that we use for Premiere, Explorer, and more!

> "I'm the person who actually made TCA Tech. I used to edit with Wondershare Filmora (not sponsored), and I wanted to edit faster, so I watched some tutorials, and coded some AutoHotKey scripts. Now that I use Premiere, I can now edit EVEN faster. Thanks, Premiere. :)" - [TCA](https://github.com/imTCA)

> "I'm one of the main video editors for TCA's YouTube Channels, alongside TCA. He gives me a lot of footage, so I had to learn how to work quickly, without sacrificing quality, and TCA just gave me these AutoHotKey scripts, and they helped me a lot in the editing process." - [Yellowed](https://github.com/Ye11owed)

### Our AHK scripts

IF YOU ARE NEW TO AUTOHOTKEY, start here: https://autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm

I know there's a lot of scripts in this repository. Look here to see what launches when me and Yellowed start our PCs: https://github.com/TCAandYellowed/AHKscripts/blob/main/INFO_and_PROFILES/Startup_Folder.png

Some of the scripts are #include-d in other scripts. The MAIN script from which most others are run, is this one - so, you can start here: https://github.com/TCAandYellowed/AHKscripts/blob/main/ALL_KEYBOARD_ASSIGNMENTS.ahk

Some scripts can stand entirely on their own, like this one: https://github.com/TCAandYellowed/AHKscripts/blob/main/Windows_Mods/Both_Accelerated_Scrolling_1.3_AND_Cursor_click_visualizer.ahk

All our custom Premiere, Photoshop, and After Effects keyboard shortcuts can be found here: https://github.com/TCAandYellowed/AHKscripts/tree/main/Settings_and_shortcuts

Please note, we're not real programmers (in this lifetime.) Our organization can be bad, and sometimes our code can be spaghetti-y. We have, however, done extensive commenting... so if you know how to code, it should be pretty easy to figure out what's going on.

Help with this repository is appreciated, but don't feel bad if we never officially merge your scripts. We can't trust anything that me and Yellowed haven't fully tested ourselves, or something with code that we don't recognise or understand. These are our real day-to-day working scripts, so we can't compromise them for anybody.

Sometimes Yellowed puts out tutorials/Behind The Scenes/Deleted Scenes on his personal channel: https://to.imTCA.tk/yellowed
